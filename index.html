  <center><h1>Homelessness in the United States of America.</h1></center>
<div class="History">The United States Of America has experienced homelessness in more than one occasion. The most famous example is the 1930’s <b>“The Great Depression”</b> era in which the homeless were often seen as poor, with nothing to eat and no places to sleep. Then between 1933 and 1939 major federal programs like the CCC, CWA, FSA, NIRA and SSA were developed to combat homelessness. These marked the end of the great depression. Though it did not get rid of homelessness, it did reduce it significantly, so problem solved, <i>right?</i><br><br> <center><img src="roaring 30.jpg"><br><br></center></div>
<br>
<div class="second">Well the year 2002 would beg to differ since they were another spike in homelessness. However, it was mostly children and families were now the largest demographic of homeless. The government had already given its ideas to end homelessness and now turned to major cities to bring a solution once more. Through this, the “Housing First” program was created. It was a way to rapidly relocate the homeless by giving them access to housing without having to go through sobriety or drug use tests. This movement underwent many criticisms some thought that it was a way for drug addicts to set up drug points but in the end, the program was funded by previously homeless individuals that got their barrings. <br><br><center><img src="housing.png"></center><br><br>

  <div class= "list"> This seems like a solution however, many people today are still homeless, and even more are youth than ever before.To better understand how to solve the problem, we must first know the common causes. In the United States of America the causes of homelessness are usually:<br><br>
    <ol>
  <li><b>Gentrification</b>: when a formerly affordable neighborhood becomes popular raising housing prices and pushing poorer residents out.</li>
    <br>
  <li><b>Internal Displacement</b>: Sometimes governments will force residents away from their permanent residences to make way for higher-priced Buildings, while compensation may be inadequate for the residents to acquire adequate housing.</li>
    <br>
  <li><b>Medical</b>: Lack of accessible healthcare can drive homelessness, physical disabilities especially can impact a person's ability to support house payments, mortgages, or rent.</li>
    <br>
  <li><b>Human and natural disasters</b>: Events like hurricanes, earthquakes, tsunamis, tornadoes and war can cause poverty and homelessness.</li>
    <br>
  <li><b>Foster Care</b>: Transitions from foster care can also impact homelessness. Specifically, youth who have been involved in the health care who leave the system often do not have a stable income or support if any at all which forces them on the streets</li>
  <br>
  <li><b>Substance abuse</b>: Different substancas can cause harmful dependancies that lead to health and living situation complications.</li></ol></div><br>
<div class="help"> So, how do we solve this homelessness crisis? Well, the answer is a bit complicated.

  <div class="Last"> In addition to all of this help, states are encouraged to help in different ways such as Texa's <b>"Guaranteed Income"</b> in which they provide pay for families in risk of loosing their homes, the many charities that aim to tackle homelessness and provided homeless shelters. While there is no "end all be all" solution to homelessness, it's important for the country to try and reduce the amount of homeless and make sure it's citizens are cared for. It's also important for us as a society to aim to help others in any way we can. Resources and more info on all these programs can be found in the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)
